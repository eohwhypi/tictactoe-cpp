# My first TicTacToe game

This is my first simple game written in C++, made for my programming class at the university. It haven't gotten me the best grade, but it was a really fun project to make for someone who was (and still is) a newbie in programming. It was originally written with Polish variable names (which is my native language), so I've translated it to English and posted it here with the intention of further expanding my programming skills by optimizing this code. First commit is pretty much 1:1 copy of my original code and although it works, it is NOT a finished project.
